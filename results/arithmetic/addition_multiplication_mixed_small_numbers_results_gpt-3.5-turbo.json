In other words, we can rewrite 17 * 17 as 17^2.\n\nNext, we can use the exponent rule that says \"the square of a number is equal to that number multiplied by itself\" to compute 17^2. Specifically, we have:\n\n17^2 = 17 * 17\n\nMultiplying 7 by 7 yields 49, with a carry of 3 to the next digit place. Then, 7 times 1 plus the carry is 24. Therefore:\n\n17 * 17 = 289\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\nfinal answer: 289",

Add the carry-over 5 from the previous step, which gives us 13. Write down the 3 in the tens place and carry the 1 to the next step.\n\n```\n   18\n x 17\n_____\n  136\n   1\n```\n\nNext, multiply 1 (the tens digit in 18) by 7 (the ones digit in 17), which gives us 7.

Write down the 8 in the tens place.\n\n```\n   18\n x 17\n_____\n  306\n   1\n```\n\nFinally, we have multiplied all the digits, so we can add up the results to get our final answer:\n\n```\n  306\n+136\n_____\n  306\n+ 16\n_____\n  306\n  16\n_____\n306 + 16 = 322\n```\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n```\nfinal answer: 322\n```",

Multiply this digit by the same digit you used in step 1 (which was 5). This gives you 5 as well.\n4. Write down the 5 next to the previous 5, in the second column from the right.\n5. Now, add the two numbers you just multiplied in steps 1 and 3 (5+5). This gives you 10.\n6.

The order of operations is as follows:\n\n1. Perform any calculations inside parentheses first.\n2. Exponents (ie. numbers raised to a power, such as 2^3 or 5^2) should be solved next.\n3. Multiplication and division should be performed from left to right.\n4. Addition and subtraction should be performed from left to right.\n\nUsing this order of operations, we can solve the arithmetic expression as follows:\n\n14 + 4 * 14 + 3 + 1 \n\n= 14 + (4 * 14) + 3 + 1     (Multiplication comes before addition)\n= 14 + 56 + 3 + 1           (Performing multiplication: 4 * 14 = 56)\n= 74 + 4                    (Performing addition)\n= 78                        \n\nTherefore, the value of the expression 14 + 4 * 14 + 3 + 1 is 78.",
