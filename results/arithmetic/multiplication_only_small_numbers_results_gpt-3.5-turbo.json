That is:\n\na * b = a * (c + d) = a * c + a * d\n\nWe can use this property to break down the multiplication operation into simpler operations. For example:\n\n19 * 6 = 19 * (5 + 1) = 19 * 5 + 19 * 1\n\nNow we just need to evaluate each term:\n\n19 * 5 = 95  (We can calculate this by multiplying 19 by 5 using mental math or long multiplication.)\n19 * 1 = 19  (This is just the number 19 added to itself once.)\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n19 * 6 = 19 * (5 + 1) = 19 * 5 + 19 * 1 = 95 + 19 = 114\n\nFinal Answer: 114",

We start by multiplying the ones digit of 9 by the ones digit of 12, which gives us:\n\n9 * 2 = 18\n\nNext, we write down the units digit of this result (which is 8) and carry over the tens digit (which is 1). Then we multiply the tens digit of 9 by the ones digit of 12, which gives us:\n\n1 * 12 = 12\n\nAdding the carry-over value of 1 to this result, we get:\n\n12 + 1 = 13\n\nOnce again, we write down the units digit of this result (which is 3) and carry over the tens digit (which is 1). Finally, we multiply the tens digit of 9 by the tens digit of 12, which gives us:\n\n9 * 1 = 9\n\nAdding the carry-over value of 1 to this result, we get:\n\n9 + 1 = 10\n\nSo the complete multiplication looks like this:\n\n  9\n*12\n---\n 18 (write down 8, carry over 1)\n13  (write down 3, carry over 1)\n----\n108 (final answer)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nfinal answer: 108",

For example, we can group the 14, 8, and 12 together as follows:\n\n14 * 8 * 12 * 15 * 15 = (14 * 8 * 12) * 15 * 15\n\nWe can then calculate the product of 14, 8, and 12 to get:\n\n14 * 8 * 12 = 1,344\n\nSubstituting this back into our original equation gives us:\n\n1,344 * 15 * 15 = 302,400\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\nfinal answer: 302,400",
