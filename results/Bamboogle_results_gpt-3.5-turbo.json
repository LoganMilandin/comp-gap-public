Gluten is a group of proteins commonly found in wheat, barley, and rye.\n\nFact #2: In its natural state, meat does not contain gluten. However, contamination can occur during processing, so it is important to be aware of any added ingredients or preparation methods that may introduce gluten.\n\nCombining these two facts, we can conclude that people with celiac disease can eat camel meat as long as it is prepared without any added ingredients or processes that introduce gluten contamination.\n\nSo the final answer is: People who have celiac disease can eat camel meat as long as it is prepared without any added ingredients or processes that introduce gluten contamination.",

This reaction damages the lining of the small intestine and can lead to a range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and malnutrition.\n\nGluten-free foods are those that do not contain wheat, barley, or rye, or any ingredients derived from these grains. There are many gluten-free alternatives available, such as rice, corn, quinoa, and gluten-free oats, as well as gluten-free versions of bread, pasta, and other foods.\n\nIt is important for people with celiac disease to strictly adhere to a gluten-free diet, as even small amounts of gluten can cause damage to the small intestine and lead to symptoms. It is also important to read food labels carefully and avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing foods during preparation and cooking."

In this book, Darwin explored the role of earthworms in soil formation and their impact on the environment. The book was based on his own observations and experiments, as well as on the work of other naturalists. Despite being one of Darwin's lesser-known works, it was well-received by the scientific community and is still considered an important contribution to the field of ecology."

Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be determined.\n\nIf there was a mistake in the question and the intended element was meant to be \"Plutonium\", the university where it was discovered is the University of California, Berkeley. However, the founding date of the University of California, Berkeley is 1868, while Plutonium was not discovered until 1940.

                "returned": "The two facts we need to combine to answer this question are:\n\n1. Lady Godiva was a historical figure who lived in 11th-century England. According to legend, she rode naked on horseback through the streets of Coventry to protest her husband's taxation policies.\n\n2. The historical country of England was divided into several Anglo-Saxon kingdoms before the Norman Conquest in 1066. One of these kingdoms was Mercia, which was located in the Midlands region of England.\n\nPutting these facts together, we can reason as follows: Lady Godiva was the wife of a powerful nobleman who held the title of Earl. Since she lived in 11th-century England, her husband's earldom would have been located within one of the pre-Conquest Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Given that Lady Godiva lived in Coventry, which is located in the Midlands region of England, it is most likely that her husband's earldom was in the nearby kingdom of Mercia.\n\nSo the final answer is: Mercia.",

The scale ranges from Category 1 (74-95 mph) to Category 5 (157 and higher mph).\n\nFact 2: The deadliest hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin was the Great Hurricane of 1780, which struck the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean. It was a Category 5 hurricane, and its death toll is estimated to be between 22,000 and 27,500.\n\nChain of reasoning:\n- We're looking for the death toll of the most intense Atlantic hurricane.\n- Fact 1 informs us that the intensity of a hurricane is measured by its category on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which is based on sustained wind speed.\n- Fact 2 tells us that the deadliest hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin was a Category 5 hurricane, which struck the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean in 1780.\n- Therefore, the death toll of the most intense Atlantic hurricane is the estimated death toll of the Great Hurricane of 1780, which is between 22,000 and 27,500.\n\nSo the final answer is: The estimated death toll of the Great Hurricane of 1780, the deadliest hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin, was between 22,000 and 27,500 people.",

As of 2016, the host of The Tonight Show was Jimmy Fallon.\n- The Late Show, which first aired in 1993 with David Letterman as the host. In 2016, Stephen Colbert took over as the host.\n- The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which first aired in 2003 and has been hosted by Ellen DeGeneres since its inception.
