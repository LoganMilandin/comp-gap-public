Tyler Shultz raised concerns about the company's testing methods and accuracy, and later shared his concerns with the Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou.\n\n2. Erika Cheung: A former lab associate at Theranos, Cheung reported her concerns about the company's practices to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Her complaint led to a surprise inspection by CMS, which eventually resulted in sanctions against Theranos.\n\nThese whistleblowers played a significant role in exposing the fraudulent practices at Theranos, ultimately leading to the company's downfall and criminal charges against its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, and former president, Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani.",
